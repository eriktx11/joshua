## How you can contribute to this project

Well, when I finished this app, I couldn't find a way to make the synchronization to be called only in certain times. The synchornization in the Sync Adapter and the Google Location request are set up properly. But everytime I hit from a detailed view, back to the main map, the synchronization runs again. I'd like to stop this, so the user doesn't notice it.
